This directory contains example snippets to be included in Doxygen-generated
documents. These are built when the host system has Doxygen installed and the
following CMake variables are set:
    BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON
    BUILD_LIBBLADERF_DOCUMENATION=ON
    BUILD_LIBBLADERF_DOC_EXAMPLES=ON


For more involved programs, see the libbladeRF tests/ directory
and the bladeRF-cli source code.
